# Book-Management-System
Overview
This project is a shopping platform built using JAVA and JAVAFX, database is MUSQL access via JDBC.
It is the course project of Wenzhou-Kean university Cps3250, Professer Sangi give me guidence.
  During the proposal stage, we initially chose C++ for development, but Professor Sangi pointed out that implementing a user interface with C++ would be challenging. We switched to Java and used JavaFX.
Originally, our statistics interface displayed all data in a simple list. Professor Sangi suggested adding data visualization to make the information clearer and improve user experience. Following his advice, we implemented pie charts to visualize inventory data.
To further enhance the systemâ€™s functionality, Professor Sangi encouraged us to add more chart types. In the final version, we added bar charts and pie charts.
Throughout the process, Professor Sangi's guidance made us realize that the choice of technology is as important as the design of the user experience. Data visualization is not only a technical improvement, but also an in-depth response to user needs.
